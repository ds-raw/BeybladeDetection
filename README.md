# BeybladeDetection
This Python script utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model to track Beyblade battles from a video, analyze collisions, and determine the winner and loser based on spin detection. The process begins by loading the trained YOLOv8 model and a video file, where Beyblade movements are detected frame-by-frame. The model identifies the Beyblade objects, calculates spin status by comparing frame differences, and tracks collisions using bounding box overlap. Once one Beyblade stops spinning, the script identifies the winner, stores relevant information (such as battle duration, detected collisions, and detected object classes), and saves the final frames of the winner and loser. Results are logged in a CSV file for further analysis.

Additionally, the script integrates with a Telegram bot, sending battle results, including a summary, images of the winner, loser, and the last condition, as well as the CSV file. The script employs asynchronous communication with Telegram, ensuring that all results are sent after the battle analysis completes.
